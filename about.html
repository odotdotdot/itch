    <p> Leverkuhn was created by Peter Bradley.</p>

    <p> The game was inspired by Thomas Mann's novel, Dr. Faustus,
        and the diversions of the fictional composer at its heart, Adrian Leverkuhn.
        Young Leverkuhn had "a mania for thinking out musical problems,
        which he solved like chess problems, spending hours linking up, in the smallest possible space,
        chords that together contained all the notes of the chromatic scale, or he would amuse
        himself by writing very sharp dissonances and finding all possible resolutions for them, which, however, just
        because the chord contained so many discordant notes, had nothing to do with each other, so that that acid
        chord, like a magic formula, created relations between the remotest chords and keys."</p>
